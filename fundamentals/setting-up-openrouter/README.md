# üõ†Ô∏è Setting up OpenRouter

## Creating an OpenRouter account

#### So that you can use quip, you'll need to create an OpenRouter account, this is so quip can access the AI and let you chat.

\
&#x20; 1\. Head over to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

2. In the top right, click Sign in and either sign in if you already have an account or sign up.
3. Once you've signed up to OpenRouter, hover over one of the the top right icons and select 'Keys'
4. Now press the blue 'Create Key' button and call it whatever you want (quip, ai, chat, etc) and leave the Credit Limit box empty.
5. Now copy the key  and save it somewhere safe, as you won't be able to see it in full again from OpenRouter (this is due to safety and privacy reasons)
